;;; Code:

;; Functions delivered with this THING-in-THING
;; group of files employ several functions at a
;; defined THING within the range of a second THING.
;;
;; `ar-hide-bracketed-in-line-atpt' for example hides everything insides brackets within the given line. Resp. `ar-show-bracketed-in-line-atpt' or a function which toggles this state: ar-hide-show-bracketed-in-line-atpt.
;;
;; Referring which implementations are to be expected, see the
;; contents lists at the bottom of thingatpt-utils-core.el which are
;; cross-used in general.

;; Further information is given with thingatpt-utils-core.el
