One way to install is putting this into Emacs' init-file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "PATH/TO/werkstatt/thingatpt-utils-core")
(add-to-list 'load-path "PATH/TO/werkstatt/thing-at-point-utils")
(require 'ar-thingatpt-utils-core)

There is some stuff around.

Probably you would want use this:
(require 'ar-thingatpt-utils)
