# thing-at-point-utils
Delivers a set of functions to return, mover over or
manipulate a given THING. 

See USAGE for details

;;;;;;;;;

To see what's implemented, consult contents of
variables at the end of thingatpt-utils-core.el as
`ar-atpt-delimlist', `ar-atpt-delimited-list', etc.

;;;;;;;;;

The idea comes from Mike Williams, author of shipped
thingatpt.el
